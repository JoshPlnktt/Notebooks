# Improving Employee Turnover with AI 📊

## Project Objective 🎯
The main objective of this project was to better understand ways to improve employee turnover. 

This was split up into 2 main goals:
- Discover potential causes through high level EDA 🔍
- Build a predictive model that can identify individuals who are likely to leave the company 🤖

## Usage 🔽
This project has a notebook and a dataset, as well as the pickled model. This can be used to play with the code without having to re-fit the model, or simply to put the model to the test.

## What's Inside 📖
Within the notebook file you will find:
- Project Context
- Data Dictionary
- Cleaning
- EDA
- Model Construction
- Model Evaluation
- Recommendations
